# storageclass

This is a convenient kustomization that adds the specified storageclass to all pvc's and statefulsets.

You need to create the storageclass if it doesn't exist yet. See [these docs](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/install/kubernetes/configure#configure-a-storage-class) for more instructions.
