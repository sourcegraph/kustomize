# Overlays

An overlay specifies customizations for a base directory of Kubernetes manifests, in this case the [base/](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph@master/-/tree/base) directory in the [deploy-sourcegraph repository](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph@master).

Each overlay is created with different kustomize components that are located inside the components directory.
